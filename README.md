### 👋 Hi, I'm ChaeYeon

I'm a backend engineer who treats **AI not just as an API, but as a development tool and a true coding partner**.  
I'm especially interested in **data flow, scalable system architecture, and building AI-powered features that run reliably in real production environments**.

### 🧠 About Me

- Strong backend foundation with **Java / Spring** and **TypeScript / NestJS**
- Hands-on experience designing **event-driven MSA architectures centered around Kafka**
- Built **recommendation systems and vector search** using **Elasticsearch kNN**

- **AI-friendly developer**
  - Implemented real-world features using **multiple LLM models**
  - Optimized AI workloads with **batching and asynchronous processing** to reduce cost and latency
  - Practice **vibe coding and rapid prototyping** using AI developer tools such as **Cursor and MCP**

👉 I aim to **build fast with AI**, while still **understanding and taking responsibility for the system under the hood**.
